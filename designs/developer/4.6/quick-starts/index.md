# Quick Starts

Quick Starts are a feature in the OpenShift Developer perspective.

The Quick Starts card on the Add page provides easy access to featured Quick Starts. Additionally, the Quick Starts card includes a link to all quick starts.

The basic visuals and behavior of this card view is consistent with that of the developer catalog and operator hub.
