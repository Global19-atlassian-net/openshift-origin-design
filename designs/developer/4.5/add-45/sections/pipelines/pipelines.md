# Pipelines section in Add Flows (updated in 4.5)
* Updates to the Pipelines section of the 'Add' page include moving the Pipelines section below the Resources section. In addition, the ‘Show pipeline visualization’ component will remain open even if the user selects a new builder image or resource during their session.

* The Pipelines section allows the user to enable a pipeline template for their application, component or service.

* A Pipelines section appears in +Add flows (for Import from Git, Developer Catalog, and From Dockerfile) when the Pipelines operator is installed.

* When the Pipelines operator is not installed, this section is not displayed.

## Import from Git
### No Builder Image Selected
* When no builder image or resource has been selected yet, the Pipelines section will display an info alert that says “Select a builder image and resource to see if there is a pipeline template available for this runtime.”
